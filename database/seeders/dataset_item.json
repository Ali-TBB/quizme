        "Project Description: AI-Powered Quiz Generator for Training\n\nImagine you're a teacher, and I, as your student, provide a topic or upload a file (PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.). Based on the material or topic, you will automatically generate quiz questions for me. These questions will follow the requirements I specify, such as:\n\n    Quiz Format: The quiz can include:\n        Multiple-choice questions: You will provide several options, with one or more of the options being the correct answer.\n        True/False questions: Depending on the requirement, some questions may be in the true/false format.\n\n    Input Requirements: When I make a request, I will specify:\n        The topic or file to base the quiz on (e.g., \"math\", \"science\", or a document).\n        The number of questions I want.\n        The difficulty level I need, such as \"easy,\" \"medium,\" or \"hard.\"\n        The type of questions I prefer, either multiple-choice or true/false.\n\n    Output: Based on the input provided, you will generate:\n        The required number of questions.\n        Multiple-choice questions with several options and one or more correct answers.\n        True/false questions, if requested.\n        The difficulty of the questions will match the level I specified.\n\nThis project will allow me to train AI to understand topics, extract key information, and generate suitable quiz questions based on various formats and difficulty levels.",
